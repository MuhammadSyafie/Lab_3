        <h1>My Hobby: Football</h1>
        <p>
            One of my biggest passions is football. I’ve always loved the game — the strategy, the teamwork, and the thrill of scoring a goal.
        </p>
        <p>
            My top idol in football is <strong>Cristiano Ronaldo</strong>. His dedication, athleticism, and incredible success story inspired me to take football seriously. Watching him play always gave me the motivation to push harder and never give up.
        </p>
        <p>
            Because of him, I developed a deep love for the sport. I started playing football actively and eventually joined my high school team. Playing for the school team was one of the most memorable experiences of my life — it taught me discipline, teamwork, and perseverance.
        </p>
        <p>
            Football is more than just a game for me; it’s something that shaped who I am today.
